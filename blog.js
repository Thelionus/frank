        title: "Task Management",
        date: "July 25, 2011",
        summary: "Task management is an underserved niche poised for growth, answering fundamental business needs that current tools like Outlook and project management software fail to address effectively.",
        content: `
            <p>Task management is an underserved niche. The monthly search for task management are less than 10% of those on project management. Task management is poise to growth and become central. It answers a fundamental business need and it is underserved by available business applications. Every manager does task management somehow. They are either using Outlook calendar or to-do list applications. Outlook and To-Do list have a very limited capability for scaling to business needs of operations. The other alternative is to try to adapt project management or CRM software such as Basecamp or or Salesforce that are not initially designed for task management. This is explaining why many of those applications end up to be cumbersome for day to day operations. Larger customer will do custom development or configure platform such as Lotus notes or Share Point.</p>
            <p>Managers are spending a great deal of their time and efforts to be aware of what is going on and taking actions if there is an out of order situations. Those tasks can easily require hours from managers having to monitor a large number of tasks and employees. Although there is plethora of software, they are either too complex, cumbersome, or specialized. Managers end up tracking their operations and employees through status reports and status meetings using emails, spreadsheets and schedulers such a MS outlook.</p>
            <p>This impacts the organizations because of managers lose hundreds of hours yearly on inquiring what is going on or is there risk of omission. This is even more prevalent when the teams to be managed are distributed geographically. Not timely managed out of order situations may lead to costly errors that may have high repetitional and client impact.</p>
            <p>Potential for task management is unlimited. People do tasks to achieve results. Any other activities are related to task being (for example collaboration, sharing, searching). In fact project management is a particular case of task management not the way around. The potential of task management is so great for organizations, that it can become as prevalent for business as the social network is for individual task management. There is an attempt to disrupt the market with collaborative and social network, but we believe that organizations need task management to manage their business.</p>
            <p>iFollow helps managers to be aware what is going. It allows them to track repeated sequences of task, individual tasks and measured data point over time. Employees and co-workers interact with iFollow only through their email eliminating the adoption barrier across the organisation. Any out of order situation, for example past due or out of range value, are detected by email alert, and color coded in a dynamic timeline visual overview.</p>

        summary: "The irony of Moody's giving negative ratings to institutions that suffered losses because they relied on Moody's own positive ratings of financial products like PCAA.",
        content: `
            <p>Moody's gave the best rating to PCAA in 2007. Desjardins lost 591 million because of PCAA in the last quarter of 2008. In 2009, Moody's express warning on the Risk Management at Desjardins since they do not manage properly complex financial products such as the PCAA.</p>
            <p>It appears that overconfidence in Moody's was one of Desjardins biggest mistake in this matter. The irony here is that Moody's rate negatively institutions (Desjardins) that are in difficulty because they relied on Moody's positive rating of certain financial product. It sound like Moody's rates Moody's' negatively.</p>

        title: "The Mechanics of Politics in IT: Part 1",
        date: "March 13, 2008",
        summary: "How escalating design decisions to upper management creates political problems in IT projects, and why executives should stay at the goal level while letting teams design solutions.",
        content: `
            <p>Last year, the government of Quebec asked Cognitive Group to do a heuristic evaluation (expert evaluating usability with a list of usability heuristics) and usability testing of their web portal. First, heuristic evaluation is not reliable because:</p>
            <p>Experts cannot assess terminology choice and evaluate task compatibility. Terminology and task compatibility account for the majority of usability problems. To my knowledge, the only effective approach to evaluate terminology and task compatibility is through usability testing and field study.</p>
            <p>The importance of heuristic (guidelines) depends of the context of use. For example, is the user going their once in a lifetime? Or is he a power user going there all the time on a mandatory basis.</p>
            <p>As I always do, I complied telling the client I will do heuristic evaluation with the help of informal usability testing instead of pure heuristic evaluation. That way, I don't loose time explaining clients why they are wrong. I asked a few colleagues or friends to act as subjects for the informal usability testing who could be representative of the audience.</p>
            <p>Following the evaluation, I found the design of the portal was poor but I was not surprised, I have often seen bad design throughout my consulting practice. As usual, most usability problems were associated with confusing wording, task compatibility issues and funky use of interaction techniques. Up to now nothing unusual. I went on presenting my findings. But, while presenting, the client constantly interrupted me saying this or that; we cannot change it because it is a decision from the upper management. In some cases the minister himself got involved in the design choices.</p>
            <p>Only later, after the formal usability testing where all users failed on all tasks, I got the client to admit the design was poor. At that point they had no choice but accept my recommendations. This situation is painful because it places the management in a bad position. They were involved in poor design decisions.</p>
            <p>More recently, a client in the airline industry told me he does not want to hear about usability because everybody has a different opinion. They often end up asking the CEO to decide. Again, I will have a very challenging consulting project because it might show the CEO made the wrong decision. Of course, I will try to find ways around it but nevertheless, it is not easy.</p>
            <p>For many organizations, design (user interface design, user requirement, and functional specifications) is a painstaking process involving fierce battle between stakeholders. When they do not agree, they escalate to upper management for decision.</p>
            <p>Escalating design decision that otherwise should be taken by the design team is a sure recipe for politics. If decisions are wrong, it will be uncovered sooner or later. Then, you will be in serious trouble.</p>
            <h3>How to prevent this?</h3>
            <p>If you're an executive, never get yourself involved in detailed design aspect. Keep yourself at the goal level and let your team design solutions. If your team tries to get you involved in design deadlock, it is because they have not done their homework or they lack expertise. Your project manager might say there is a deadlock; he needs your help to move forward. He will try to reassure you by saying he will fix the usability issues later. Don't believe that, it will never happen and you will get stuck with a poor design for years. Stress it to your team you don't care if the screens are blue, white or yellow as long as users were able to achieve their goals rapidly, without hesitation and errors. Get an external usability company to evaluate the design of your internal team so you will get an objective assessment of the design. Don't worry about the susceptibility of your people, there is an easy way to manage that. If you don't show leadership, you risk to be stuck with poor design for years if not forever.</p>
            <p>Never forget, usability equals productivity. The first reason why we use technology is to improve productivity, so good design is extremely important.</p>
            <p>If you are member of a project team, base your design decision on facts instead of opinion. How? Learn usability best practices, build a prototype and test your design with users with usability testing. If you do not have this expertise, don't hesitate, get and external consultant in usability.</p>

        title: "Leading change: the practitioner's view",
        date: "January 3, 2008",
        summary: "Effective leadership requires being right first, then communicating facts. This piece explores the four steps of leading change: being right, communicating facts, gathering more facts, and preventing bias.",
        content: `
            <p>A few years ago, I was in a group that got lost during a hiking trip. One member of the group said "I know the way out. We just have to turn right and walk in that direction for 10 minutes; we will see a little farmhouse and the road to civilization". He was sure of himself. We followed his lead but after 15 minutes of walking, no sign of the little farmhouse. The group began questioning the direction. After a while, it became obvious that we were led in the wrong direction. This leader failed and the magnitude of his failure was greater because of the high degree of confidence he expressed.</p>
            <p>This graph shows the evolution of George W. Bush's approval rating over time. His approval rating rose to 68% in March 2003, at the beginning of the Iraq war, and declined steadily after that. It is now at 26%. Not only did the war not proceed the way he had told people but there is a growing number of Americans questioning the idea of going to Iraq in the first place.</p>
            <h3>How to lead?</h3>
            <h4>First: be right</h4>
            <p>No matter how good you are at executing and communicating, and how much charisma and resolution you have, if you are wrong, you will fail. Churchill was resolved but he was right. In the hiking story above, the leader was sure of himself but wrong. He overestimated how lost we were.</p>
            <p>To be right, you need facts.</p>
            <p>In real life, we do not know with certainty the actual situation. In the context of uncertainty (most real life situations), the more certain you are the more likely you will be wrong. Facts are even more important in uncertain situations. Why? What you know and what don't know are facts. "I am lost in the forest" is a fact. If the leader in the hiking story would have admitted the true level of uncertainty about how lost we were, he could have proposed a series of tests. For example, he could have propose a short walk in a different direction to gather more facts about the current location. A negative result would then have been seen as new information on where not to go instead.</p>
            <h4>Second: Communicate facts (reason for change)</h4>
            <p>It is very difficult to convince people to change something if they are not convinced about what the problems are and their urgency, see John Kotter. Two economists might disagree even if they use the same economic model. By separating fact from opinion, we might understand the input or assumption and understand why those economists disagree. Whenever you make a decision where people must follow your lead, facts are the essence of getting people agreeing on the current situation and the course of action.</p>
            <p>In business transformation (change Management), facts are more than data "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts." (Sign hanging in Albert Einstein's office at Princeton), facts are like an observable situation that can be described and shared.</p>
            <p>Once facts are gathered and separated from opinion, they can be shared during working sessions. Those sessions permit the group to agree on problems. Consequently, it will be much easier to get the group to agree on a course of action once they have agreed on the problems. During those working sessions, the focus is first on the current situation, not the course of action. Ensure everybody that they are respected and never discard people expressing bad news (don't shoot the messenger). Often they might be your best source of facts. To ensure the free flow of information, remove red tape, formal presentation and favor a more informal organization with a high degree of respect, see ''The Death to Bureaucracy" from Jack Welch.</p>
            <h4>Third: gather more facts</h4>
            <p>Often, you need to collect more facts. Creativity and imagination are required to gather facts. For example, in the above story, a series of short walks in different directions is an approach to gather more facts on the current location. Gathering facts is boiled down to: observation, experiment, calculation and simulation. Fact gathering is not a consensus driven process. You are collecting evidence. Never rely on opinion. Humans are biased and opinions rarely correlate with facts.</p>
            <p>In business transformation initiative, the best sources of fact are field studies. The field is rich and wild; people develop very sophisticated tactics in real work environment. Knowledge lies in the field, not in meeting rooms. The worst source of facts is the traditional hierarchy : line manager, director and executive. Facts gathered through this path will surely be altered, trimmed down or hidden.</p>
            <h4>Fourth: prevent bias</h4>
            <p>Facts may be distorted. When relying on human sources, multiple independent sources are required. Be careful with surveys or focus groups, they do not gather facts but opinions. They provide the tip of an iceberg. Avoid group meetings. Groups are only good to solve problems, to brainstorm or share information.</p>
            <p>Objectivity does not exist; you have to cope with that.</p>
            <p>No matter how good the information is, if you are biased, or already convinced of the answer, you are in danger. A bias could, for example, lead one to accept or deny the truth of a claim, discard evidence or look for evidence that confirms a preconceived idea (confirmation bias). In the hiking story, the guy seemed so sure of himself that we trusted him even if the direction he gave did not ring a bell to us.</p>
            <p>To reduce bias, observe yourself to see if you feel emotional. You need to detach yourself. It is well known that a lawyer should never defend himself or a medical doctor should never diagnose himself. Ask different persons in a one on one session to interpret facts. Don't give them your thoughts. Observe the difference in their interpretation. Try to think as fresh as you can. Gather all facts prior to a decision. In order to avoid bias, good investigators will collect evidence and then conclude. After all this work, let the decision emerge naturally. If you still do not feel not comfortable, your instinct will tells you there is something wrong, listen to it. It means there are still uncertainties that you have to work with, or simply wait.</p>
            <p>The four steps described here relate to making the right decision and communicating that decision (vision) to a group of people. Once you have the right direction and a group of people agreeing with you on the course of action, executing change is a piece of cake.</p>
            <p>Leading people in the right direction requires hard work, time, experience and wisdom. You can get there faster by practicing the right thing. For more on the subject, I suggest reading John Kotter on this subject and "Engineering psychology" by Christopher Wickens.</p>

        title: "10 things to do for the success of your web site – the practitioner view",
        date: "December 1, 2007",
        summary: "Practical guidelines for web design success, focusing on user needs, limited attention spans, readable fonts, and avoiding common design mistakes.",
        content: `
            <p><strong>1. Know what is important.</strong> 1. Bring users to your site, 2. Ensure usefulness and usability, 3. Maximize trust. You will make much more money trying to bring users to your site and ensuring good usability than trying to have beautiful flash and look. Most users care only about finding rapidly what they are looking for and achieving their goals. They don't care about color and visual appearance. When they find what they are looking for, they usually don't notice the look. Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Ebay and Craigslist are very successful but they are not beautiful, they are effective.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Avoid having wrong design goals.</strong> For example minimizing the number of clicks. To ensure having the proper design goals, know the users, their goals and the context of use. If users are going to your site once in a while on a non-mandatory basis (online banking, news, shopping…), you have to treat them as a novice. They have to understand instantly how to use the site. In this context, it is preferable having a few more clicks and pages with less information. On the other hand, for power user, speed is more important. In this context, less actions, pages and clicks are more important.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Do few things and do them well.</strong> For example for an e-commerce site, ease of finding the product, having the right information on the product and trust are the key success factors. For a search engine, ease of entering queries, speed and pertinence are the key success factors. Don't spread your energy on other features unless you master your key success factors better than any others.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Design for user limited attention.</strong> On the web, many users have little patience and do many things at the same time (they might go on your site while at work). Within 10 seconds, they will abandon if they don't find what they are looking for. Since the reading speed is about 200 words per minute, you can provide a maximum of 35 words to read before a user abandons. So minimize the quantity of text. Contrary to TV where the full screen is in use, on a computer, only a small portion of the screen is viewed simultaneously (roughly 6 to 7 cm diameter). This is due to the useful field of view, which corresponds to the subtended angle of the fovea vision. Information must be grouped within this diameter. That's why banners are so ineffective. For most page layout you can afford about 4 to 5 groups. Avoid long lists of items, users read only the first few items at the top of the list. Organize according to the natural eye path. Remember users start from the top left corner, go to the center and if they don't find what they are looking for, then they try to go to the left expecting a menu. For this reason, avoid menus on the right. The bottom right is the worst real estate of a page.</p>
            <p>This sketch show the typical eye pattern on a web page.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Avoid relying on branding.</strong> Users do not remember seeing your ads, brochure and other corporate information. Keep your brand simple and name your entire product line in relation to a user goal. If you already have a brand for a product, provide a prompt matching the user goal. This also help SEO (Search Engine Optimization). For the same reason, you don't need to be that consistent between corporate brochure and web site.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Users don't read, they scan.</strong> Users will scan text and when they find something that is likely to meet their goals, they click on it. You better to expect that users won't read your text. A good approach is to provide just a list of hyperlinks with a large font. You can also provide a small description with a maximum of 15 words with smaller lighter font under the hyperlink. This technique is ideal for a newsletter. Users will scan the list, if they are interested, they will click on it and read the description under it.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Ensure users understand your text and graphics.</strong> At least 50 % of the usability problems are related to the wrong choice terminology. Users get easily confused between concepts such as events and news, schedule and time table…. Minimize the number of concepts. Don't worry, users mix apples and oranges. Test and test again your site with real users to find the right terminology.</p>
            <p><strong>8. Don't reinvent the wheel.</strong> Use basic web controls. You don't need to create complex navigation structure. A simple menu and the browser's back and forward button are Ok for most of the cases. Once users have a successful behavior, they continue to us it for other goals. For example, if they find something through the menu, they will try this method again for another goal. Limit your design to familiar controls. Use straight hyperlinks to select a page. You will make more money with blue underlined hyperlinks because the users' reaction time is about 30 ms less.</p>
            <p><strong>9. Use readable font.</strong> If users find the information and can't read it, it's zero. Why using small fonts? If your fonts are too small, only younger users will be able to read it. With the right size, everybody will be able to read it. Fonts must have a size equal to 1/200th the distance of reading for proper readability. On a computer screen, fonts must be at least 3 mm. For example MS Sans Serif or Verdana at a minimum of 11 points are Ok. Font adjustment controls don't work because most users that would need them never use them. Those having serious reading problems already have special adjustments on their browser.</p>
            <p><strong>10. Be permissive to errors.</strong> Users make errors. The best way to manage errors is to allow them. For example, be permissive to various date formats. On the other hand, if users make errors, ensure proper detection, recovery and simple messages. Messages must have two items: the status and the corrective action.</p>

        title: "Christine Whitman's Nuclear Option",
        date: "October 1, 2007",
        summary: "A response to claims about nuclear energy being efficient and reliable, highlighting that human errors at all levels make catastrophic accidents an ongoing risk.",
        content: `
            <p>This letter was published in Business Week</p>
            <p>"Whitman says: "Despite its controversial reputation, nuclear is efficient and reliable." Yet since 1950 there have been 20 nuclear accidents. One was major (on Mar. 28, 1979, at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor) and one catastrophic (on Apr. 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant). How can we say a major nuclear accident will not happen again?</p>
            <p>Here's the reality: Accidents occur because humans make errors. Those errors can be hidden at the design, maintenance, management, operation, and even the regulation level. In addition, there are conditions that increase the likelihood of human error such as fatigue, stress, attention and memory overload. The risk of another catastrophic nuclear accident exists. While the risk is low, the consequences could be disastrous.</p>

        date: "July 28, 2007",
        summary: "Exploring how design impacts human errors through the classic stove layout example, and why managers need to stop blaming employees and instead focus on preventing errors through better design.",
        content: `
            <p>You arrive at home after a long day and you rush to prepare food. You turn-on the burner but oups !, you realize that you activated the wrong burner. You feel frustrated and tell yourself "I should have paid more attention". If it is a new stove, you might tell to yourself "I should have look at the instructions". Some might even blame themselves for this error.</p>
            <p>Sounds familiar, you're not alone. Almost all users of the classical stove design, as showed in figure 1, activate the wrong burner at one time or another.</p>
            <p>Why? It is in the human nature to associate objects that are side by side. As showed in the figure 1, the controls of the back burners are closer to the front burners. We cannot tell witch control activates what. This layout is highly error prone. To ensure we activate the right burners, we need to pay attention and look at the instructions. See also Don Norman's Design of Everyday Things.</p>
            <p>With the layout presented in figure 2, there is no confusion. Association of control with the burner is now easy because the layout of control is compatible with the layout of the burner.</p>
            <p>This example demonstrates design can play an important role in preventing human errors. A design that respects human's nature and limitations will reduce the likelihood of errors.</p>
            <h3>Human error in managing human error</h3>
            <p>After having done hundreds of interviews with managers, we observed when discussing employee's errors, most managers:</p>
            <p>Blame employees for lack of attention or for lack of training (practice).</p>
            <p>Overlook the possibility of preventing errors by a redesign of workstation or processes.</p>
            <p>In our highly advanced technological society, we are still at the Stone Ages in term of human errors management</p>
            <p>The stove example is the tip of the iceberg. Human errors are everywhere; from day to day errors such as trying to pull a door that should have been pushed to high impact errors such as: being attentive on the wrong signals and crashing a plane killing hundreds of people, having the wrong information and making bad investments, forecasting the wrong economics figures, misjudging intelligence report and brining a nation to war, making the wrong medical diagnosis, underestimating a budget for a project and being insouciant of consequences of our action on the environment.</p>
            <p>Most of those errors, boils down to a combination of human errors that are at the cognitive level. They are errors of detection, attention, planning, estimation calculation, judgment, decision, comprehension, discrimination and execution.</p>
            <p>Although aircrafts are still crashing, the safety record of the aviation industry is impressive when compared to other industries. At the end of World's War 2, the aviation industry realized, following the pioneer work of Alphonse Chapanis and Paul M. Fitts, that human errors were caused by subtle inherent human cognitive limitations. The Aviation industry stopped blaming pilots or maintenance personnel for human errors decades ago. They tried to understand the inner cause of human errors.</p>
            <p>This demonstrates it is possible to move away from the stone ages in a few decades. Managers need to stop limiting explanation of human errors to the lack of attention, lack of training or poor personnel selection and expand their analysis of to the real nature of human errors.</p>

        date: "March 31, 2008",
        summary: "A critique of modern education through the lens of Einstein's original relativity paper, arguing that current teaching is 'junk education' that prioritizes equation-solving over philosophical understanding.",
        content: `
            <p>I am currently reading the latest biography of Albert Einstein by Walter Isaacson. I then decided to download the original 1905 paper of Einstein on the special theory of relativity. I was very impressed to see how beautifully Einstein exposed his theory but at the same time, very shocked to realize how poor the teaching I received about this was.</p>
            <p>During my study, the teacher just exposed briefly the postulate of relativity and went on spending most of the time in class deducing the equations. We then had to go home solving problems for hours. I was thinking I understood it, but in fact, I was like a technician capable of solving problems and passing an exam. I must admit I didn't grasp the full philosophical meaning of those equations. The teacher skipped the fundamental philosophical questions on the relativity theory. Only years later, after reading other books on relativity did I fully grasp the concepts.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the teaching I received, Einstein starts in his magnificent paper by first defining time. He showed that what is simultaneous for one moving body compared to another might not be for the other. With those notions and the principle of invariance of physics law that includes the invariance of speed of light, it is easy to understand that the classical notion of absolute time must be abandoned. After stating the fundamental principles, Einstein went on deducing consequences of those philosophical principles, the mathematical equation and the consequence on the notion of space and energy.</p>
            <p>Einstein provided the fundamental philosophical concepts first and deduced the equation while the current teaching is just based on applying equation to solve problems.</p>
            <p>In education today, little time is spent on the philosophical questions underlying the history of discoveries and the fundamental principle behind those notions. In science and engineering, most of the teaching time is spent developing equation and students manage to pass the exams.</p>
            <p>The teaching is like junk food, it is "junk education". Students get cramped with a lot of technical stuff without really spending time on underlying philosophical questions. I suspect that's why, the bridges designed by Quebec engineers (from the OIQ) since 1970 are crumbling. Engineers are trained not to question norm and standard; they are just applying formula without questioning as long they are protected.</p>
            <p>Einstein used to say that "Imagination is more important than knowledge". During a trip in the United States, a reporter asked Einstein a question from the Edison questionnaire (a list of 150 factual questions): "what is the speed of sound?" He admitted "I do not carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books". So Einstein would have failed that question in an exam.</p>
            <p>I attended the IDSA conference in October 2007 where Sir Ken Robinson gave a talk on education. It was very much in line with Einstein. He stressed that imagination is the most important intellectual skill. He explained vividly that our education system destroys imagination. I invite you to watch his talk keeping Albert Einstein in mind.</p>

        summary: "The fundamental problem with IT project management: estimation happens before functional specifications are complete, making budgets and timelines essentially guesswork.",
        content: `
            <p>I was recently hired by an important financial institution from Canada to help them assess their strategy for a transition to a new a version of their content management software. Content management software is a portion of an imaging system that allows users to scan documents, index an image, retrieve and view image documents.</p>
            <p>The current version at the financial institution is a Windows based GUI (graphical application based). The proposed version was totally web based. After a business review that included a field study and cognitive analysis, I discovered that both the current and the new software didn't meet the business needs. In fact the current version required lot of manual entries and was highly error prone while the new version would not address those issues and would, in addition, require three times more user action.</p>
            <p>I soon made my client aware of this. The project manager, who is from the information technology department, reacted by saying the project scope is to make the transition, respect deadlines and budget. Meaning he does not want to change the plan. Information technology department even contested my findings and required me to demonstrate the facts again. After revisiting my findings they realized that the situation was even worst than they expected it. In the end, the financial institution followed my recommendations because the facts were rock solid and we found a solution that would integrate existing technology already in use at the financial institution.</p>
            <p>Sounds familiar? Many IT (Information technology) projects are planned and scoped before analysis or field study is done. In many instances, the justification is a technology replacement or and upgrade. Over the last twenty years I devoted my consulting practice on project turnaround and I encountered hundreds of similar situations.</p>
            <p>Last year I attended a three day PMI (Project Management Institute) training camp. What amazed me the most was the widespread acceptance by the PMI community of the irony of planning and estimation for software projects.</p>
            <p>Here is the problem:</p>
            <p>To estimate a project, you must first know the amount of work required to complete the project. To build two (2) kms of road will require twice as much work than building one (1) km.</p>
            <p>In a software project, the amount of work is defined by what (the functions) you will build. You will have a good idea of the functions you will build after the functional specification phase. Since the functional specification is usually done after the planning and estimation, you get the information you need to estimate the project after the project is started. It is a bit like if you have to plan and budget the medical treatment before the diagnostic is done.</p>
            <p>I can assure you that in physics, my previous career, you would get fired or put aside fairly fast if you come up with something like this.</p>
            <p>What is more, estimation at the planning stage is guesswork. In PMI methodology, they mention arcane techniques such a point of function method or historical data or some other combinations but again, this is, in my view, a sophisticated cover up for guesswork. Yes, there are calculation methods but the input assumptions are based on human judgment (guess). Those judgments vary from one person to another. Often, the estimator does not have any ideas about the business and operations. For example, in the Government of Quebec, software architects estimate after meeting user's representatives that previously met business analysts who never met end-users.</p>
            <p>Typically, once estimations are done, budget, scope and timetables are established. The board approves the budget, people are hired and project execution begins. If you discover in the course of the project that real business needs differ from what you planned, the story above is repeated. The project manager will tell you it is out of scope. Or he might say your new findings could be filed as change at the end of the project. Remember, he is hired to execute the plan even if proven wrong. Isn't he?</p>
            <h3>There are solutions:</h3>
            <p>Do you ask yourself if the application you are using (email, office application etc) is in Java, PHP, C Sharp, etc? Most of us will answer "I don't care". In fact, 100% of the user experience (UX) is provided by the user interface (UI). So why not start the project by the end. Why not design and test the user interface before the project is established and a budget is set. Then you will know what to build.</p>
            <p>Look at other industries, such as automotive or aerospace. They all start by verifying their biggest risks first. When Airbus or Boeing want to develop a new airplane, they build a large-scale model, display it at Bourget salon and take orders even if the plane does not exist. If there is not enough order, they will cancel the project. Car manufacturers, design clay models, present those models in a show room to verify if the client will buy it. Then they will plan production. So both automotive and aerospace start by the end.</p>
            <p>Remove red tape and bureaucracy. Allow direct communication between developers and users</p>
            <p>Invest in continuous business analysis processes where field study (ethnographic study) is part of the culture. To my knowledge, the best approach to do business analysis is the cognitive approach.</p>
            <p>Budget business analysis and diagnosis throughout the operation on a continuous basis.</p>
            <p>When executing verify risk by simulation, experimentation or calculation.</p>
            <p>Allow information to circulate though project by keeping project size small</p>

        summary: "Why Montreal street signs are dangerously unreadable and the scientific law of font size that city planners should follow: fonts must be 1/200th the reading distance.",
        content: `
            <p>Just back from SanFrancisco, I was trying to find an address in Montreal.</p>
            <p>I had to slow down in order to read the street name. While slowing down, a car almost hit my back bumper! Hope it doesn't sound familiar but I am sure it happens frequently.</p>
            <p>On this Montreal picture, you can barely see the streets signs.</p>
            <p>Montreal street names are poorly located and the font size is way too small.</p>
            <p>How many car accidents happened as a result of this?</p>
            <p>I wonder why city planners do not seem to known the law of font size.</p>
            <p>In Montreal, this rule is violated everywhere: billboard signs, parking signs, print documents, etc.</p>
            <p>How the heck can someone read the Montreal street signs?</p>
            <p>What should be the font size for normal readability?</p>
            <p>The answer is: 2 X Tan (0.3 degrees/2) X reading distance</p>
            <p>The angle that provides good readability for 95% of the people is 0.3 degrees. For a reader at a distance of 60 cm it results in a font size of 3 mm. For a reader at 50 meters, it is 25 cm or one foot. A good approximation is roughly 1/200 of the distance. Montreal city road planners should learn from SanFrancisco.</p>
            <p>On this picture, you can see there is a much bigger Mason street sign on a green background.</p>
            <p>Note that this sign has been added over the small one.</p>
            <p>The legibility rules are respected: Mix and San Serif fonts on green background and a size above one foot enough for 50 meters distance readability.</p>

        title: "Change Management : A Catch-22",
        date: "September 5, 2007",
        summary: "The real challenge in change management lies at the skill level—unconscious, non-verbal operations that are difficult to communicate but critical to understand through cognitive task analysis.",
        content: `
            <h3>The catch-22</h3>
            <p>The levels at which impacts of change are major are not understood while the levels at which impacts are minor are easily understood.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Most managers believe people resist change because humans have a natural desire to keep the status quo. They believe that resistance to change is a defense mechanism caused by frustration and anxiety. With this diagnostic, executives belief that good change leadership comes with a strong message from the top, effective communication plan, mandatory training and sometimes, removing undesirable parties that are labeled as strong change resistant.</p>
            <p>In fact, Individuals aren't really resisting the change, but rather resist the loss of status, loss of pay, or fear they will not be able to achieve the same level of performance. While causes of losses of pay or statuses are visible, causes impacting performance involve factors at the unconscious level that are difficult to communicate.</p>
            <p>We observe that in many business transformation initiatives those fears were justified. New processes would not permit anymore efficient tactics evolved over years of trial and errors.</p>
            <h3>How can we distinguish between fear and facts?</h3>
            <p>First, let's look at the nature of change in human work, the impact of business transformation initiatives and to finish, what to do about it.</p>
            <h3>Why change is difficult in work setting?</h3>
            <p>Change happens on an individual and organizational basis. Change is everywhere: mergers, new policies, new technology, new management . . .</p>
            <p>Employees resist change because they have to learn something new. They fear the unknown future and their ability to perform.</p>
            <p>The unknown comes from subtle and nonverbal aspects of human work that are difficult to communicate.</p>
            <h3>The nature of work</h3>
            <p>Jens Rasmussen observed that human work is either at: the skill level, rule-based level or knowledge level. Don Norman also came to the same conclusion.</p>
            <p>When driving a car, turning the wheels is at the skill level while letting the other car passes at the intersection is at the rule-based level. Deciding to choose a route over another one is the knowledge level.</p>
            <p>In addition, we observe that there is a fourth level, usually called "meta-cognition" but I prefer to use "wisdom", which involves self-awareness about our own limitation. For example, if tired or drunk, hopefully, we might decide not to drive.</p>
            <p>Any human activity: tasks, sport, arts or leisure lies within those levels.</p>
            <h3>The impacts of change</h3>
            <p>Changing something at the knowledge level is relatively easy. If someone shows you a better route to go somewhere, you only need to understand the advantage and good indications and voila, you can execute the change.</p>
            <p>At the rule-based level, it is a bit more difficult but manageable. For example, if the state decides to change the law and permit right turn on red light, an action previously forbidden, at first you need to pay a little bit more attention to apply the new rule. You may even forget to apply it but with little time and patience, turning on the red light will become natural.</p>
            <p>The real challenge is at the skill level. Let's say the car manufacturer decides to invert the position of the break pedal and gas pedal. It will take you months of practice and you might make many errors that might event kill you. Change will be very difficult to accept and you might express a high degree of frustration. You will certainly not use this car if you have the choice.</p>
            <p>Those examples show that: efforts to execute a change at the skill level are much higher than at the rule-based or knowledge based level. The level of energy required is dependent of the level of work affected by change: being at the skill, rule-based or knowledge based level.</p>
            <p>Convincing a golfer to change his swing is a much more difficult challenge than convincing him to change club number to reach the green. It requires much more energy to acquire the new swing.</p>
            <h3>The proposed law of change:</h3>
            <p>"The effort to execute change will be equal to the amount of energy required to execute the same level of performance."</p>
            <p>"The amount of energy required to change is the highest at the lowest level of wok affected". Skill based being the lowest level while knowledge based being the highest level.</p>
            <h3>Business Transformation</h3>
            <p>In business transformation initiatives, people only understand impact of change at the knowledge and rule-based level but not the ones at the skill level. Skill level is mostly non-verbal and unconscious.</p>
            <p>For example, during a word processing task, users might select backspace to delete few letters or they might select the mouse to delete a paragraph. The choice is usually unconscious. This is a good example of a natural way humans optimize energy. According to the keystroke model, it takes 1.2 seconds to delete 6 letters with backspace and it takes 2.6 seconds with the mouse.</p>
            <p>Now, let's say a vendor convinces management to adopt a new word processor. While nicer and with more features, it doesn't permit using backspace anymore. It is likely that this subtle change would be unnoticed even during a demonstration. Only after implementation employees will complain and express their frustration. As good performers, employees will be frustrated because they cannot achieve the same level of performance. They might even express anger.</p>
            <p>This is only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, in a real work setting there is a myriad of such optimizations tactics: being a particular noise, a visual clue, a physical arrangement, a specific sequence…</p>
            <h3>What to do about it</h3>
            <p>There is a science, Cognitive ergonomics (called Human Factors in USA), which permits the understanding of human work at all levels including the skill level. Cognitive task analysis permits gathering both verbal and subtle non-verbal operations such as eye movement, cognitive processes and unconscious manual movements. Understating work at all levels permits the understanding of the impact of change at all level of work.</p>
            <p>Managers can stop managing change with brute force.</p>
            <p>First: stop doing endless meetings and politics and go in the field. Wake-up and forget the meeting rooms, the real world is in four dimensions.</p>
            <p>Second: do a field study and cognitive task analysis to fully understand the current situation. Field is rich and wild; people develop very sophisticated tactics.</p>
            <p>Third: select a solution or design a new system that will permit skill transfer, keep efficient tactics and strategies and remove problems.</p>
            <p>Fourth: before any implementation and at the earliest stage possible, design mock-ups, simulate and test them in the most realistic manner as possible. This is even truer with physical devices because there are so many subtle interactions with the environment.</p>
            <p>Easier said than done but at least try to change the change management practice if you want to bring change in your organizations.</p>

        date: "July 11, 2007",
        summary: "Analysis of the De la Concorde bridge collapse in Laval, examining the human errors in design, standards, and inspection that led to five deaths.",
        content: `
            <p>In September 2006, a bridge collapsed in Laval (a Montreal suburb), resulting in 5 deaths. An inquiry, the Johnson commission, is trying to understand this event and prior incidents.</p>
            <p>As always, multiple factors are involved in this accident: bad design, shoddy construction, poor repairs and substandard construction materials. These factors are always boiled down to human errors: a design, planning, executions or maintenance errors.</p>
            <p>The first most frightening errors are associated with the substandard preparation of the concrete.</p>
            <p>The Canadian Standard stated in 1966 that for concrete, the ratio of water-cement should have been 0.47 or 0.54 depending on the type of usage. A higher ratio means a more fragile structure. It results in more porosity in the structure that may have more damaging consequence when submitted to rough weather over the years.</p>
            <p>1) Engineers from Desjardins Sauriol either ignored those standards or were over confident with the security factors. They used 0.56 ratios, which is just over the superior limit.</p>
            <p>2) Even more, the 1967 Canadian standards are seriously questioned by Jacques Marchand from the University of Laval, in a report requested by the Johnson Commission.</p>
            <h3>Human errors</h3>
            <p>Everybody knows humans make errors. But humans rarely make errors on purpose or with bad intent. Humans make errors because of subtle and invisible psychological mechanisms that are either at the:</p>
            <p>Skill level: for example a typo</p>
            <p>Rule level: application of the wrong rule</p>
            <p>Knowledge level: not having the right information or the right knowledge stored in long-term memory</p>
            <p>Meta cognition level: Humans develop strategies (wisdom) to circumvent their cognitive limitations in judgment, attention, and memory. For example a good inspector will wait to have all information on hand before making a judgment. He knows if he doesn't, he might be anchored by his first impressions. Banks know that bankers are biased and could be influenced by the client. So decisions to accord loans are performed by a separate group of risk managers.</p>
            <p>Not knowing the standard is a rule based on error. It can be explained by a lack of knowledge or information about the existing standards. By cognitive task analysis (analysis of the thought process), root cause can be identified and strategies can be devised to prevent those errors.</p>
            <p>Being overconfident with the standard is a lack of wisdom or more formally a meta-cognition error. It is much more frightening error because if wrong, hundreds of bridges and structures could be affected.</p>
            <p>History teaches us that regulatory agencies make errors and standards are updated with new knowledge. Even physics' laws are updated over time with new discoveries. A bridge is an open system. Many things can go wrong during construction: poor soil analysis, poor material preparation and selection, construction workers not following the plan. Things can change during years of usage: weather, salt and abrasiveness, load on the bridge.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the 20th century, constructions (bridges, overpass, equipments) were solid and built to last while paradoxically engineering knowledge was limited. For this reason, security factors used were much greater.</p>
            <p>In the 60, 70, engineers believed they could master nature and were overconfident with standards (lack of wisdom). While standards have been improved, they are maid by the same organisms with the same methods. Engineers still believe in those new standards today. Sadly, engineers today are trained in the universities to calculate and apply rules, not to question. Later, in their senior years, they are trained to ensure they will not be sued.</p>
            <p>In reaction to the Johnson commission, we hear comment such as: "it will be costly to inspect all those bridges" or "I was not responsible of the maintenance, the city was responsible". Wake up, we are not talking about money or who should be blamed, we are talking about security! What will be the cost if everybody is frightened that another bridge would fall? Those reactions are certainly not a manifestation of wisdom.</p>
            <p>Solution one: standards should become guidelines. In case of an accident, engineers will always be accountable event if the guidelines are proven wrong. Consequently, engineers will ask more questions and might use higher security factors.</p>
            <p>The second most frightening factor is the competency of authority.</p>
            <p>There is conflict of interest at the MTQ (ministry of transport of Quebec) because, under the same ministerial budget, they are in charge of building, maintaining and inspecting. If the budget is low, they might be tempted to allocate more budgets on new stuff. This will result in neglecting existing work or worst, neglecting inspection tests because they are costly. Sounds familiar? That is exactly what happened for the la Concorde Bridge.</p>
            <p>Solution 2: Separate jurisdictions for inspections. This independent jurisdiction should have full power to close a structure or a bridge. With this separation, hopefully, we should avoid conflict of interest and judgment errors such as the one in de la Concorde Overpass.</p>

        date: "July 9, 2007",
        summary: "The essence of innovation is rapid experimentation. Silicon Valley succeeds because it functions like the Wright Brothers' wind tunnel—enabling fast trial and error cycles.",
        content: `
            <p>LeRoi Gourhan, a French Anthropologist, observed that during pre-historic times there was a close relationship between the evolution of the human brain and the hand. In science, the experimentation plays the role of the hand. There is a close relationship between new observations and new scientific ideas.</p>
            <p>Newton observed the apple falling and devised the law of gravity; the telescope permitted Galileo to observe planetary motions and devise new conception of the solar system; Einstein following observations from Michelson-Morley devised the theory of relativity. Today, experimentations became more costly and take longer time. Scientific evolution has slowed down by longer time to gain results from experimentation. Nowadays, complex experimental apparatuses take years to build and require large investments.</p>
            <p>Technological innovation follows a similar path.</p>
            <p>"The Wright brothers built and tested a series of kite and glider designs from 1900 to 1902 before attempting to build a powered design. The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their 19th century predecessors. Their first glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested. As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift, though they missed the effect of Reynolds number (known since 1883), which would have given them an even bigger advantage. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider design, which they flew in 1902. It performed far better than the previous models."</p>
            <p>Their wind tunnel permitted a series of rapid trial and errors that would have taken them years to achieve. The Silicon Valley is a land of rapid trial and errors. There are hundreds of new start-ups with young entrepreneurs willing to try new ideas. Time between new ideas and commercial products is short. High concentration of VC, University and high-tech companies render the whole region as the equivalent of the wind tunnel for the Wright Brothers.</p>
            <p>The essence of innovations is observation. The essence of observation is experimentation. So to increase innovation capacity, it is essential to devise new ways to shorten the time of experimentation. That being a wind tunnel or new way to finance start-up.</p>

        content: `
            <p>Gartner provides obscurantist research analysis and reports for IT professionals.</p>
            <p>Over the years they have been consistently wrong:</p>
            <p>– They recommended IT managers to choose OS2 over windows</p>
            <p>– In September 2001 they recommended that companies using Microsoft IIS for web hosting should switch to alternative products in light of increasing Internet worm attacks</p>
            <p>– In October 2006, Gartner issued a statement that they believed Apple Computer should abandon its hardware business and instead license it to alternative PC manufacturers, such as Dell.</p>
            <p>When I read their analysis, it gave me the impression they view technology like accountants that check only the cost but omit the benefit.</p>
            <p>On the iPhone, Gartner said in InformationWeeks several obstacles stand in the way of its fitting into the enterprise:</p>
            <p>Lack of support from major mobile device management suites and mobile security suites</p>
            <p>Lack of support from major business mobile e-mail solution providers</p>
            <p>The operating system platform isn't licensed to alternative hardware suppliers so there are no backup hardware suppliers</p>
            <p>Feature deficiencies, such as no removable battery, which could increase the need for support</p>
            <p>At this point, it's only available from one US operator</p>
            <p>It's an unproven device from a vendor that's never built an enterprise-class phone or mobile device</p>
            <p>A high price estimated at $500</p>
            <p>A clear statement from Apple that it's focussed on consumer, not enterprise, business</p>
            <p>In my view, these objections are biased :</p>
            <p>– Point 1,2,6. Lack of support or unknown or unproven device: It is a new device! It has always been the case for new device. Early adopters and innovators will go forward while followers will wait and see. Some corporations such as Goggle, Apple, Intuit, Cirque du Soleil are innovators. If we were to follow this logic, there would not be any innovations in America.</p>
            <p>– Point 3. The operating system of Blackberry wasn't licensed to any alternative hardware up to 6 months ago. Why is it a problem for Apple and not for RIM?</p>
            <p>– Point 4. Removable batteries. This is new battery technology and Apple has reason to design this way. So you have to wait and see if it is a good system design choice.</p>
            <p>– Point 5. Only in US. It is a problem for only those traveling a lot around the world.</p>
            <p>– Point 7. High price. For what it does, it is a computer, phone camera, and ipod, it is not bad.</p>
            <p>– Point 8. Yes Apple focuses on the customer but many products designed for large audience have their place in corporations (word, excel, ….) . Why is it a problem?</p>

            <p>Innovation can come from outside. In the case of Apple, the GUI (graphical user interface) was invented at the Xerox Park by a group that included Larry Tesler who later went to Apple to work on the Apple Lisa and the Mac. The Ipod OS (operating system) was designed by Pixo, an external firm. To do so, making a network of innovators, university and start-up is important.</p>
            <p>Design around the user's needs and simplicity, not the demand. You sell with demand but design by focusing on the user's needs. When Ipod was launched there was no demand but Steve Jobs stuck to his instinct. In fact Apple as always integrated technology and simplicity with users in mind. Macintosh, Ipod and now the Iphone are all great innovations, but they were not the first. The characteristics of those innovations are not the novelty in functionality but the simplicity and user experience. It gives access of these novelties to a wider audience.</p>
            <p>Ignore what the market says today and target new customers. The Ipod is an example. The simplicity makes the Ipod accessible to a wider audience. This innovation created the demand and consequently the market. Steve Job stuck to his instincts</p>
            <p>Fail wisely. Most of the Apple success came from previous failures. The Mac emerged from the Apple Lisa failure, The Iphone is a response to the original music phone project with Motorola. When failure arises, learn form it.</p>
            <p>In my view, the most important aspect is the Apple culture. It is not an engineering driven company but a design driven company. Decisions are not based on technical constraint. Of course, designers listen to engineers but they will sometimes ask them to go back to the drawing board and think again and be creative to achieve the design goal. For example Bill Atckison wanted the screen of the original Apple Lisa to be white instead of the traditional black in order to imitate the paper. Engineers at the time were strongly opposed saying it would consume more memory etc…but Bill stuck to his point and the engineers found innovative ways to achieve Bill's design goal.</p>

        title: "Sketching User Experience",
        date: "May 23, 2007",
        summary: "Review of Bill Buxton's important book on extending the concept of sketching to user experience, enabling rapid and cheap verification of ideas before building expensive prototypes.",
        content: `
            <p>I just finished the book « Sketching User Experience » by Bill Buxton. This book in my view is an important book. It will have a profound impact on the designer community. They will say:</p>
            <p>"WOW, I should have used this or that sketching technique and I would have saved huge amounts of time and money instead of building those expensive prototypes".</p>
            <p>It broadens the concept of sketching to the user interaction or in other words user experience.</p>
            <p>In Wikipedia, a sketch is defined as a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not intended as a finished work.</p>
            <p>The objective of a sketch is to verify an idea rapidly and cheaply. Bill extends the concept to user experience. He describes a multitude of sketching techniques such as Wizard of Oz, Video, and paper mockup as a way to test user experience rapidly and cheaply.</p>
            <p>The current level of maturity of user experience design (interaction design) is at its infancy just as was industrial design of the beginning of the previous century.</p>
            <p>Most industrial designers and system designers make the same mistake. They jump too fast in the detail, hardware or technology. So they spend too much and learn about the user experience.</p>
            <p>My view is that the concept is so important it could be extended to all kinds of system design disciplines.</p>
            <p>This idea of verifying idea rapidly and cheaply is a necessity in some industries so it exists for years. For example in aerospace, the equivalent of a sketch is to place a model in a wind tunnel to verify the aerodynamic cheaply. In microelectronics, sketching is equivalent of a software simulation. As Bill Buxton describes in his book, the biggest risk when designing a new car model is the market. So car designers will build clay models and test the reaction of the market.</p>
            <p>As for sketching user experience, sketching a project risk is absent in most initiatives. Such as business process renovation, information technology, R& D initiative and even in a business investment.</p>
            <p>I believe that with creativity it is possible to sketch anything.</p>
            <p>For example, I recently designed a market place for Jet charter brokers. These guys are like Wall Street brokers, their time is precious.</p>
            <p>They had to phone vendors, check opportunities on web sites and constantly monitor emails to check if there is a new opportunity. Those emails are real time. At any time, there could be a new incoming opportunity. So they felt compelled to go back and forth to check those emails. There was also a great risk of omission</p>
            <p>I studied those emails and sensed it would be possible to automate the reading of them. I went back to the IT department. But they told me it would be very expensive to build an algorithm to understand free unstructured text.</p>
            <p>So in one night, I sketched the algorithm. I took about 100 of those email and devised 100 basic rules, I ran them with an excel spread sheet. After the simulation (sketch of the algorithm), I was convinced that it would work</p>
            <p>I went back to the IT guy, gave him the rule and told him to implement the algorithm</p>
            <p>The system is currently in operation. Brokers save time and each day they make a lot of money with this system.</p>
            <p>So, I propose we could extend the concept of sketching the user experience to sketching the project risk. It could be making calculations, building a model, simulating the behavior, or in some instance setting a theatrical role play, etc..</p>
            <p>There is always a way with creativity to figure out how to cheaply and rapidly verify a project risk.</p>

            <p>I recently assisted at a speech given by Michel Leblanc at the Big Bang on may 17, 2007. This is certainly one of the best speeches I have ever attended. I can assure you I have seen some, I have just arrived from the CHI 2007 conference in San Jose.</p>
            <p>First, Michel Leblanc didn't use any PowerPoint. He simply walked in front of us and delivered his speech.</p>
            <p>Second and most importantly, he is truthful, blunt and highly credible on his subject. He is without any doubt an expert in his field and uses brilliant storytelling to make his points. The direct language that is sometimes a bit rough just reinforces his sincerity. I felt I was sitting in front of an intelligent person simply looking for the truth.</p>
            <p>I also hired him for some of my clients in the USA and I can assure you he is effective and brings real results. I highly recommend him to anyone who is looking to acquire clients on the Web.</p>

        summary: "Why laboratory usability studies can miss critical problems that only emerge in real work settings—the difference between usability and usefulness requires field observation.",
        content: `
            <p>You have to provide your friend with driving directions to come to your home. All of a sudden, your are struggling. Is it two or three stops before turning right? Providing a direction can be very difficult even if you take that route everyday.</p>
            <p>Cognition is distributed. Because our memory is optimized, our knowledge is ingrained within our environment. We retain only what is necessary and use the environment to retrieve sequences.</p>
            <p>Recalling the direction to drive home is no problem when you are driving home. On the other hand, trying to recall an experience out of context is prone to error. Consequently, trying to gather information about a process and human work or evaluate a solution out of real context of use is wrong.</p>
            <p>That's why we have to be very careful about laboratory studies. In one of our recent usability studies for an online bill payment application, we initially found users were able to accomplish their tasks efficiently and they expressed their appreciation. At a later phase, during testing in real work setting, we discovered users still had to reconcile check numbers with bank statements. In this context, online payment created more trouble than benefit. Initial laboratory studies didn't provide the right insight into these problems.</p>
            <p>Evaluating usefulness (real practical advantage) out of context is as difficult as giving driving directions out of context.</p>
            <p>Since users cannot really recall or imagine how they will use a product in real work setting as demonstrated above, it is only by observing usage in real work setting we can understand how a product will be used.</p>
            <p>Many disciplines and authors such as Dan Diaper (by the way, he is currently looking for a job?) stress how important it is to study work and behavior in real work setting. Our practice has demonstrated over and over how essential it is. You may also read about the Cognitive Approach.</p>
            <p>While usability can be evaluated in a laboratory, usefulness has to be evaluated in real work setting.</p>

        content: `
            <p>Usability expresses the ease with which people can employ a particular tool or object in order to achieve a particular goal. Usability can also refer to the methods of measuring usability and the study of the principles behind an object's perceived efficiency.</p>
            <p>In human-computer interaction and computer science, usability usually refers to the efficiency or ease of learning with which the interaction with a computer program or a web site is designed.</p>
            <p>Usability can be extended to multiple contexts such as consumer electronics, written instruction or mechanical objects.</p>
            <p>Usability metrics are essentially:</p>
            <p>– Speed—How much time it takes to accomplish a particular task</p>
            <p>– Error Rate-How many errors within a task sample users are making</p>
            <p>– Ease of learning—How much time it takes to learn</p>
            <p>Usability metrics depend greatly on the context of use and users profiles. For example, a user performing 100 transactions daily for many years will be looking for speed. A user using a design once in a lifetime might be looking for ease of learning. A user doing a critical action that might affect safety of a system will try to avoid errors.</p>
            <p>User satisfaction is a by-product of usability. A more usable design makes a user happier.</p>

        content: `
            <p>Cognitive Engineering also called Cognitive Ergonomics comes from Industrial engineering. It is an Integration of Engineering, and Cognitive Ergonomics. From the Greek words "ergon" (work) and "nomos" (science of), "Ergonomics" means the study of humans at work.</p>
            <p>Cognitive Engineering places particular emphasis on the analysis of cognitive processes – e.g., diagnosis, decision making and planning It aim to enhance performance of cognitive tasks by means of several interventions, including:</p>
            <p>user-centered design of human-machine interaction and human-computer interaction (HCI);</p>
            <p>design of information technology systems that support cognitive tasks (e.g., cognitive artifacts);</p>
            <p>development of training programs;</p>
            <p>work redesign to manage cognitive workload and increase human reliability</p>
            <p>Like a medical scanner that provides a clear view of the inside of the human body, the cognitive approach provides and inside view of the business. Why: The Cognitive approach permits to gather information and understand operation up to the thinking processes level. It allows a deeper understanding of the business problems or needs. This thorough understating will be then translated into better decisions. Overall, the Cognitive approach comprises the rigorous practice of gathering information, human information processing, analysis, business modeling, and simulation.</p>
            <h3>Gathering information</h3>
            <p>Instead of relying only on meetings, surveys or internal documentation; information is gathered in the field with "thinking out loud" techniques while people are performing their tasks. This ensures a deeper understanding of the current situation. Even if a process is totally changed, gathering information with the cognitive approach exceeds the risks of not doing so.</p>
            <h3>Information processing</h3>
            <p>To understand the thinking process, goals and knowledge, a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) is performed. Cognitive goals, sub-goals and methods are then described hierarchically. Methods are extracted with "how" questions, and goals are extracted with "why" questions. At the end of the process, management will have a deep understanding of the operations, problems, and strategies. This ensures an effective way to optimize any process. Cognitive task analysis serves also as input for defining the requirements of an information system.</p>
            <h3>Process Modeling</h3>
            <p>The business is modeled as a hierarchy of systems and processes. The highest level is the mission, followed by generic functions, specific functions and ultimately, at the most detailed level, the structural elements. The gathering techniques along with the cognitive task analysis ensure that the business model will be grounded with reality. This provides a complete and exact picture of the operation to management.</p>
            <h3>Simulation</h3>
            <p>Before executing a plan, each risk is analyzed and addressed by simulation and calculation. For example, in information technology (IT), user acceptance is often the prime risk. Simulating the user interface prior to writing any line of code ensures that the user and the business needs are first met.</p>

        content: `
            <p>You are glancing everywhere searching for information on your computer screen. Soon, you start to feel frustrated and lose patience. Suddenly someone come to your rescue. Standing just behind your shoulder, this helper rapidly points out where to look on the screen. You may or may not have experienced it but this story is related to the notion of Useful Field of View (UFOV).</p>
            <h3>UFOV</h3>
            <p>It is the single most important concept in effective screen and web page design. It is at the essence of human attention, a central issue in Cognitive Engineering.</p>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>There is a small area in the retina that provides the clearest vision of all. This vision is also called the central vision or foveal vision. It corresponds to a spot making an angle of 3 degrees. So for someone sitting in front of a computer screen, the size of the spot of visual attention is about 4 cm. For someone standing behind the shoulder of somebody else in front of a computer screen, the size of the spot is about 8 cm. The spot is about 24 cm when watching television at a normal distance. So somebody standing just behind you will have a broader spot than you and will be more likely to find the information your are looking for on the screen.</p>
            <h3>Increasing Sales</h3>
            <p>In the example above, if information is outside the UFOV, it will not be recognise or perceive. Consequently, if you place adds anywhere, they will not be effective because they are likely to be outside the UFOV. Knowing what users are looking is a fantastic insight when combined with the UFOV notion. A designer can suggest new cross-related option (or add) and present them inside the UFOV.</p>
            <h3>Google</h3>
            <p>This concept is simple and effective and it explains why Google's Add is so successful. Why not do the same?</p>

When looking at each individual skill, he was average. Average skater, average snapper, average cardio shape. But he had unique ability to oversee the game. Wayne Gretsky used to say: "know where the puck will be next". He had a unique sense of timing, rapid response to changes and situation awareness.</p>
            <h3>Jazz</h3>
            <p>In Jazz music, Oscar Peterson is considered, by many, as world best jazz piano player of the 20th century. If we analyse each individual skill: such as scale, arpeggio, playing perfectly the notes, he might not be rated as the best. But when it come to timing, such a layback on the time stretching the time or pure swing, "he is head and shoulder above everybody else" Hank Jones. Similarly to Wayne Gretsky, who new when to make a pass, Oscar know when to press a key. Oscar Peterson has an outstanding sense of time, anticipation, and situation awareness.</p>
            <h3>Cognitive Skill Training</h3>
            <p>Cognitive skills such as being aware of where you are, where your other player or musician are, recognizing pattern, sensing the dynamic of motion, rapid response to dynamic changes are at play here. Daniel Gopher develops training approaches for military and recently adapted his approach to basketball training. He developed a game call Intelligym. The key findings of Daniel Gopher are:</p>
            <p>§ Cognitive performance can be substantially improved with proper training. It is not rigidly constrained by innate, fixed abilities.</p>
            <p>§ Cognitive task analysis enables us to extract major cognitive skills involved in any task.</p>
            <p>§ Attention control and attention allocation strategies are a critical determinants in performing at top level in complex, real-time decision-making environments</p>
            <p>§ Those skills, and other associated, can be improved through training</p>
            <p>§ Research shows that stand-alone, inexpensive, PC-based training is effective to transfer and generalize performance.</p>
            <p>§ The key for success is to ensure Cognitive fidelity, this is, that the cognitive demands in training resemble those of the real life task.</p>
            <p>The new training process is the following</p>
            <p>1) To develop the skill to rapidly response to change, Gopher proposes a protocol he call I Emphasis change is a training protocol. Subjects are required during training to systematically change their effort, attention allocation on sub-elements of a performed task. The acquired skill includes a developed ability to adapt to changes. It is a powerful tool in shaping up the nature of expertise and its strategic flexibility. When improvising in a cutting contest, the jazz players develop rapid response to change and must develop ability to listen to various level of the performance.</p>
            <p>2) This "whole task" approach increases transfer and adaptation capabilities, vs. traditional part task training, which decomposes the complex task and trains elements in isolation. However, whole task training is harder at the beginning-there is slower progress at early stages of training. Natural learning of jazz music or language skill follows similar approach. You learn the global phrase, you try to play globally the musical line without specific knowledge instead of learning specific technique first such a chord or scale.</p>
            <p>3) Intermittent schedules of feedback (vs. full one), to help retention and transfer. In jazz, reaction from other musician or public is of this nature.</p>
            <p>4) Encouragement to explore alternatives to reach a general optimum. This exploration is important: we want to help the user find a flexible, and personal best, match between his abilities and task demands. In the tennis example, we know that McEnroe and Boris Becker have different styles, but both are Wimbledon winners. We want to make sure the user increases sensitivity to real-time changes in the environment and expands his or her ability to cope with them. In jazz, what make musician stand out from the pack is the originality of the sounds, line and approach more that speed and technique.</p>

Many of these errors were not detected with traditional mean of observations. Instead of hiring more employees as requested originally by the line manager, executives decided to follow our recommendation and invest to prevent these errors. The result was, a reduction of 30% of the number of employees at the back office, and an increase in the quality of the service.</p>

            <p>The Cognitive Approach comes from Industrial engineering. It is an Integration of Engineering, and Cognitive Ergonomics. From the Greek words "ergon" (work) and "nomos" (science of), "Ergonomics" means the study of humans at work. Like a medical scanner that provides a clear view of the inside of the human body, the cognitive approach provides and inside view of the business. Why: The Cognitive approach permits to gather information and understand operation up to the thinking processes level. It allows a deeper understanding of the business problems or needs. This thorough understating will be then translated into better decision. Overall, the Cognitive approach comprises rigorous practice of gathering information, human information processing, analysis, business modeling, and simulation.</p>

        title: "Understanding the value of a Usability Study",
        date: "October 29, 2006",
        summary: "The difference between marketing studies and usability studies: marketing tells you what promises to make, usability tells you how to keep them.",
        content: `
            <p>Often at Cognitive we are asked the question of what is the benefit of doing a usability study compared to a consumer marketing study. While it is true that both studies examine the satisfaction of the client in relation to a certain product or service; each of them provides different insights into the relationship of costumer-product. While the aim of a marketing study is tell you what promises to make to your customers, or what the general public may think of your product, a usability study will give you insight into how to improve your products and services so that those promises are kept. What drives you to purchase a product is different from what motivates you to regularly continue using it.</p>
            <p>As an example, imagine that a customer has bought a cell phone, based on the promise of a broad spectrum of functionality; what makes the user happy is the fact that his cell phone is easy to use and indeed helps him to keep in contact with others.</p>
            <p>Usability concentrates on understanding the way the consumer uses the product, such as the thinking process involved in achieving a task, subtle operation, points of attention, and the internal and external factors that influence the interaction with the device in question.</p>
            <p>The document ISO 9241-11 (1998) Guidance on Usability, issued by the International Organization for Standardization, defines usability as: "The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use." A usable object will be:</p>
            <p>Effective: was the task fully completed? Were the user's goals met?</p>
            <p>Efficient: was the user able to complete the task quickly?</p>
            <p>Prevent errors: did the user interface help users avoid making errors? Were errors minor rather than major? if the user made an error, did the interface assist them in making a successful recovery?</p>
            <p>Be Easy to learn</p>
            <p>Satisfying to use</p>
            <h3>How a usability study works</h3>
            <p>A usability study involves a working session where the individual user interacts with the product or its prototype. Usability studies aim at assessing the points at which the user faces difficulties or hesitations while performing a task, and analyses the navigation and thinking process of the consumer whilst using a product. Usability studies focus on the potential errors that might occur while using a particular product, and assesses how easy is to recover from these errors.</p>
            <p>The main activities that distinguish a usability study are: Performing tasks with the user. In a user study, each user is asked to complete one or more tasks related to the product or service studied. Each step is carefully recorded and analysed. The precision in recording and analysing these steps makes the results of a user study much more specific and actionable than a simple satisfaction rating. Improving products and services. The main purpose of a usability study is usually to help to improve a product (or service), and make it work more efficiently. Usability has a broad knowledge of best practice. Combined with user research, the insight that usability conveys helps increase customer satisfaction of the product. Subsequently, satisfied customers buy more of your products and services, and enthusiastically recommend them to others. A company that includes usability as part of their development cycle allows the product to be better specified from its inception. The process will be rewarding in terms of accurate product development schedules and the final product will require fewer product support enquiries and incur fewer returns. Various companies have experience the benefits of this approach. For instance, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), approached the Cognitive group to determine how best convert the cumbersome and manual process of opening a second account, to an easy, self-service online model. RBC now saves more than $1.5 million a year through an online process and enhances customer loyalty every day.</p>
